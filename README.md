# SecurityWebScanner

## Description:
The Security Web Scanner is a Google Chrome extension that will help keep its users' web surfing safe from malicious and phishing websites. Everytime the user is about to enter a website, the extension will first run through the website using its algorithms. If its cybersecurity score is too low, then it will block the user from entering that website. It will instead redirect the user to a different website that lists the security risks the website poses. Users will still have the choice to continue to the website despite the risks.

What separates the Security Web Scanner from other web scanners is that it will give a star rating based on how the algorithms measured the website's safety. Users can click on the extension at any time while on the website to review the star rating. Websites with low star ratings will automatically be blocked.

## How to Use:
Simply install it into a Google Chrome browser as an extension. In its current state, developer mode will need to be enabled

## User Data:
Users have the right to know what data will be recorded from them. Whenever a malicious website is caught due to a low star rating, that website will be stored in the extension's data base as well as various other information such as:
- Website Name
- Mac Address
- Domain
- TimeStamp
- Location accessed
- Reason for block

## Star Rating:
There will be a variety of certain points of interest that will weigh that website's star rating such as:
- Domain Age
- Google Index
- Website Hosting Location
- Treated by a link shortener
- Known malicious link
